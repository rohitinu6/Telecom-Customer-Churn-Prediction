# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer behavior and service usage patterns, the model helps identify customers who are likely to leave, enabling businesses to take proactive retention measures.

## 🚀 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights
- Machine learning models for churn prediction
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Business insights for customer retention strategies

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains customer information, including:

- **Contract Type**
- **Monthly Charges**
- **Tenure**
- **Payment Method**
- **Internet & Call Services Used**
- **Churn Status**

## 📊 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost

## 🔥 Results

The models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC score. The best-performing model helps identify high-risk churn customers effectively.
